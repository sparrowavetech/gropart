## Extending

Easily register any model with Daily Dos, and instantly add task management to your model.

To register Your Model, in your service providers boot method

```php
if (defined('DAILY_DO_MODULE_SCREEN_NAME')) {
    \Skillcraft\DailyDo\Supports\DailyDoManager::registerHooks(YourModel::class, 'Model Name');
}
```

Your model only needs to implement 1 Method, This method returns the list of to-dos for the current day when the cron runs daily.

In your model
```php
public function getDailyDoTasks():array
    {
        $daily_tasks = [];

        /**
         * Add Your Code Here.
         * 
         * The end array should be as follows.
         * 
         * $daily_tasks[] = [
            'module' => {Model Here},
            'title' => {Task Title},
            'description' => {Task Information},
          ];
         */
       
        return $daily_tasks;
    }
```


## Optional But Recommended

If your source model is updated, and the task for it would change, its important to change the Models extended class as follow.
This automates and syncs tasks to any new information when your source model is updated.

```php
use Skillcraft\Core\Models\CoreModel;

class YourModel extends CoreModel ...
```

# Manually Syncing

If prefer to manually sync your models daily dos, then simply call this class and pass your model.

```php
(new \Skillcraft\DailyDo\Actions\SyncDailyDoAction)->handle($yourModel);
```
